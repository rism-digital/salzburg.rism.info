<br>
<p>At several stages within the more than thousand years of its existence, the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg’s court chapel achieved an outstanding reputation within Europe. Musicians who made their contribution to the development of occidental music, such as Paul Hofhaimer, Johann Stadlmayr, Tiburtius Massaini, Stefano Bernardi, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, Georg Muffat, Johann Ernst Eberlin, Leopold and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Michael Haydn, lived and worked in Salzburg and were – at different times − part of the chapel. 
</p>
<p>While a large part of the music composed for the court has been lost, the sacred music has been preserved, kept safe in a room on the first floor of the cathedral since the time of its consecration (1628). Today this collection is stored in the air-conditioned depots of the newly erected Archive of the Archdiocese Salzburg (AES), which offers excellent conditions for preservation and use.</p>

<p>The RISM Salzburg working group was founded in 2007 to catalog these holdings. </p>
