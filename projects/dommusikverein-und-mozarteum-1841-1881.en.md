In cooperation between the archive of the Archdiocese of Salzburg and the International Mozarteum Foundation, the historical holdings of the „Dommusikverein und Mozarteum” (Society for Music at the Cathedral and Mozarteum) are currently cataloged and digitized. This society, founded in 1841, split into two organizations in 1880: the “Dommusikverein” (Society for Music at the Cathedral) and the “Internationale Stiftung Mozarteum” (International Mozarteum foundation). As a consequence, the library holdings were split between the two institutions. One part is today in the Bibliotheca Mozartiana of the International Mozarteum Foundation, and the other part in the Archive of the Archdiocese of Salzburg.

Most valuable parts of the collection are the letters of Mozart and his family, as well as an important collection of music autographs. Main focus of the project is on music manuscripts which will be cataloged in the RISM database. Work has already begun with the so called “Mozart estate”, the estates of Mozart’s sons Carl Thomas (1784-1858) and Franz Xaver Wolfgang (1791-1844). This part of the collection not only contains works by Mozart, in fact it comprises many works by different composers from the 18th and 19th centuries.

The project is part of the Digital Mozart Edition (DME), a cooperation between the Mozarteum Foundation and the Packard Humanities Institute in Los Altos, California, USA. Director of the project is Dr. Ulrich Leisinger as director of the DME, responsible for the project is Dr. Armin Brinzing as director of the Bibliotheca Mozartiana. Members of the research staff are Dr. Eva Neumayr, Dr. Lars E. Laubhold, Dr. Tobias Apelt and Dr. Peter Rohrmoser.
